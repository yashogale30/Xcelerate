## How it Works

### Data Collection
Data was collected using the Udacity simulator in manual mode by driving around both available tracks. The data includes:
- Center, left, and right camera images
- Corresponding steering angles, throttle, and brake values

### Model Training
A convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed to process the camera images and predict the steering angle. The architecture is based on NVIDIA's self-driving car model.

### Autonomous Driving
The trained model is deployed via a Flask API. In autonomous mode, the simulator sends real-time images to the Flask server, where the model predicts steering angles to control the car.

### Files ###
- `Behavioral_Cloning.ipynb`: Google colab python notebook for data preprocessing collected by manual driving in udacity simulator and training a CNN model to map the images from centre, left and right camera to corresponding steering angle.
- `model.h5` : Model stored in memory after succesfull training of the CNN model
- `app.py` :  Flask API to deploy the trained model in autonomous mode in Udacity Simulator.

# End to End Learning #
End-to-end learning in self-driving cars refers to a machine learning approach where a single neural network directly maps raw input data, such as images from a camera, to driving actions like steering, acceleration, and braking. This method simplifies the traditional pipeline by eliminating the need for separate components like perception, planning, and control, allowing the model to learn driving behaviors from large datasets of driving scenarios.
